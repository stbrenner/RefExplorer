    <h1>.NET Reference Explorer</h1>
    <p>
    This tool helps you to check, on which other assemblies, a certain .NET assembly relies on. It displays the dependencies in a directed graph and informs you, if the referenced assemblies are available and which versions are required.
    </p>
    <p>To start, either <strong>drag and drop the assembly</strong> you want to check, into the Reference Explorer window 
    or go to the Entry Points tab.</p>
    <p>For updates and more information please check out <a href="about:homepage">this website</a>.</p>
